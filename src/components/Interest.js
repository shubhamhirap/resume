            Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
            outdoors. In the Monsoon and winter, I am an avid traveller. I liked
            to Visit the fort and enjoy the scenic views and nature from the
            heights.
          </p>

            When forced indoors, I follow a number of Thriller genre movies and
            television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount
            of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the
            front-end web development world.
